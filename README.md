Overview

This project leverages advanced face recognition technology to simplify attendance tracking. The system uses OpenCV for facial recognition, HarCascade for face detection, and Streamlit for a sleek interface. It efficiently records punch-ins with a single press of 'O' and logs the data into a CSV file, ensuring accurate records with the help of the datetime package.

Features

Face Detection & Recognition: Utilizes OpenCV and HarCascade to detect and recognize employee faces.
Attendance Logging: Logs punch-in details such as name and timestamp into a CSV file.
Speech Feedback: Uses the Windows SAPI to provide verbal confirmation of attendance.
Streamlit Integration: Displays the attendance records in a user-friendly interface.
Customizable Background: Includes an option to display the captured video feed on a custom background.
